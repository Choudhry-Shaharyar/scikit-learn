User Questions
==============

Engage with the scikit-learn community and seek answers to your questions:

- **StackOverflow**: Ask questions tagged with `[scikit-learn] <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scikit-learn>`_.
- **General Machine Learning Queries**: For broader machine learning discussions, visit `Stack Exchange <https://stats.stackexchange.com/>`.

When posting questions:
- Use descriptive titles.
- Provide detailed context, expected results, and actual observations.
- Include code and data snippets (preferably minimalistic scripts, up to ~20 lines).
- Describe your data and preprocessing steps, including sample size, feature types (categorical or numerical), and the target for supervised learning tasks (classification type or regression).

**Note**: Avoid asking user questions on the bug tracker to keep the focus on development.

Bug Tracker
===========

Encountered a bug? Report it on our `issue tracker
<https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues>`_

Include in your report:
- Steps or scripts to reproduce the bug.
- Expected and observed outcomes.
- Python or gdb tracebacks, if applicable.

Enhance your report with a link to a `Gist <https://gist.github.com>`_ containing a standalone script and a sample of your dataset (use `numpy.savetxt` for exporting CSV files).

**Tip**: Gists are Git repositories; you can push data files to them using Git.
